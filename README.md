# Radar-Velocity-Calulation
Calculate velocity of targets based on beat frequency. 

Using the following MATLAB code sample, complete the TODOs to calculate the velocity in m/s of four targets with the following doppler frequency shifts:[3 KHz, -4.5 KHz, 11 KHz, -3 KHz].

parameter values
radar's operating frequency, frequency = 77 GHz
wavelenght, lamda
frequency shifts, Fd
velocity of targets, Vr
Doppler Velocity Calculation
c = 3*10^8;         %speed of light
frequency = 77e9;   %frequency in Hz
